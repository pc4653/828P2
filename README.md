Looking at generative model as a replacement for bootstrap in Alexandrov's mutation signature pipeline


Progress so far:

Looking into Variantional Autoencoder: 
following pytorch's example on VAE, replacing the input data from MNIST to simulated data, generated by the metrics of 28 categories and N samples, 5 signatures. 

input was set to be 28 by 28, assembling 28 sequences of 28 length into the same size as MNIST 

**Note 1. MNIST was normalized to 0 and 1 (sigmoid was used as the output activation) - whether normalizing simulated data to 0 and 1 is questionable - in general most values are closer to 0, probably better to use another scheme

Note 2. Whether treating simulated data as sequences is useful is questionable? At the least didn't expect worse output than before but may be wrong
Note 3. Current encoder and decoder uses one wide fc layer before activation, prob better performance on deeper layer
Note 4. Variantional Autoencoder gives a generative model, probably more sane to simply use autoencoder to make sure the general concept works first.
Note 5. try WGAN later

Results so far:

Interestingly engouh, there is some mix result with VAE - here is the log for pipeline running over genereated data:

1st run:
the average Frobenius reconstruction error is: 
65.1315292319
the forbenius reconstruction error for the set of estimated P is: 
16.4943449169
the average silhoutte width for each cluster is:

average silhoutte width for all is: 
0.786492471439
0 signature has the highest similarity with 1 signatures with 0.993470673477
1 signature has the highest similarity with 4 signatures with 0.315196501982
2 signature has the highest similarity with 3 signatures with 0.414266812421

The first signature gets recovered exactly, but not the rest, why?
