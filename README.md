### Looking at generative model as a replacement for bootstrap in Alexandrov's mutation signature pipeline

TO DO:

Change the set up from wide one FC layer to deep layers;

Adding dropout to the network;

Generative different sets of signatures to see if similairty between signatures give problem for the network and that if bootstrap actually helps;

Investigate the discovered feature/latent space represented by the decoder - does it have the linearity that other space have? if so we can try playing with arthrimatics in feature space - if feature vector of 5 mutations sigs - feature vector of 2 mutation sigs from the 5 = feature vector of 3

Investigate Poisson noise resistance of the input data


### Variantional Autoencoder

this picture explains variantional autoencoder pretty well: 

![Alt text](vae.4.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

The idea is that, to make an autoencoder a generative process - and not just a decoder recovering from a encoded, existing data, which is what autoencoder does - we try to force the encoded message z to have a certain distribution - gaussian in this implementation - and instead of giving the decoder the encoded message, we can sample from the distribution and feed the generated result to the decoder. After training the decoder should be able to capture the hidden processes that give rise to true data and generate data that's realistic - in the sense that it follows the hidden processes, but also different from input data/not pure memorization but capture of semantic properties.

Progress:

Adjusted the VAE structure to use ReLu as the output activation, and discarded normalizing data to (0,1); use MSE instead of BCE as loss function. Results significantly better:

### comparing the signautres extracted from generated data to the simulated data's true signatures:

![Alt text](1960000_sig_extract_com.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")


### Observations:

1. The extracted signatures on generated data are close to the true signatures; however, not absurdly close compare to NMF on bootstrapped original data.

2. The neural network/decoder-encoder is able to learn about the latent structure of the orginal data, to further validate this, let's look into the original data and generated data

Here is a picture of the input data from subplot 2 - 9, the signatures are plotted on 1:
![Alt text](1960000_orig_com.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

and here is the picture of the generated data:
![Alt text](1960000_gen_data.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")


We can see that the genereated data is very similar to unit addition amongst the true signatures - they are also obviously not simple resampling/bootstrapping results. Clearly this decoder network 'recognizes' that certain mutation categories do not play a strong role in the mutation signature's shape, and thus didn't generate a lot of those mutations. This is why in the dimension reduction stage of Alexandrov's pipeline, we are seeing 16 of the 28 mutation categories dropped. 



**3. interesting observation, bootstrapping actually seems to be making a difference - not sure why, maybe the generated signatures are too close together? - further investigation needed **

**here is results without bootstrap used, can see that some of the signatures are not seperated, although the overall cos similairty is still relatively high**

observation: mostly still have good result, consider the sample size is a lot smaller, specifically one of the signature was not found. Can look into the possibility of why.

Looking into Variantional Autoencoder: 
following pytorch's example on VAE, replacing the input data from MNIST to simulated data, generated by the metrics of 28 categories and N samples, 5 signatures. 

input was set to be 28 by 28, assembling 28 sequences of 28 length into the same size as MNIST 

**Note 1. MNIST was normalized to 0 and 1 (sigmoid was used as the output activation) - whether normalizing simulated data to 0 and 1 is questionable - in general most values are closer to 0, probably better to use another scheme**

Note 2. Whether treating simulated data as sequences is useful is questionable? At the least didn't expect worse output than before but may be wrong

Note 3. Current encoder and decoder uses one wide fc layer before activation, prob better performance on deeper layer

Note 4. Variantional Autoencoder gives a generative model, probably more sane to simply use autoencoder to make sure the general concept works first.

Note 5. try WGAN later

Results so far:
