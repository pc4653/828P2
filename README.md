Looking at generative model as a replacement for bootstrap in Alexandrov's mutation signature pipeline


Progress so far:

Looking into Variantional Autoencoder: 
following pytorch's example on VAE, replacing the input data from MNIST to simulated data, generated by the metrics of 28 categories and N samples, 5 signatures. 

input was set to be 28 by 28, assembling 28 sequences of 28 length into the same size as MNIST 

**Note 1. MNIST was normalized to 0 and 1 (sigmoid was used as the output activation) - whether normalizing simulated data to 0 and 1 is questionable - in general most values are closer to 0, probably better to use another scheme

Note 2. Whether treating simulated data as sequences is useful is questionable? At the least didn't expect worse output than before but may be wrong

Note 3. Current encoder and decoder uses one wide fc layer before activation, prob better performance on deeper layer

Note 4. Variantional Autoencoder gives a generative model, probably more sane to simply use autoencoder to make sure the general concept works first.

Note 5. try WGAN later

Results so far:

Interestingly engouh, there is some mix result with VAE - here is the log for pipeline running over genereated data:

The first signature gets recovered exactly, but not the rest, why?

Progress:

Adjusted the VAE structure to use ReLu as the output activation, and discarded normalizing data to (0,1); use MSE instead of BCE as loss function. Results significantly better:

**interesting observation, bootstrapping actually seems to be making a difference - not sure why, maybe the generated signatures are too close together?

**here is results without bootstrap used, can see that some of the signatures are not seperated, although the overall cos similairty is still relatively high
